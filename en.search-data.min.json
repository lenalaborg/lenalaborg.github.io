Overview This document describes installation steps before operating LENA Server on a typical VM Host environment. For the complete features and operational guidance of LENA, refer to the separately provided Administrator Manual.\nThis document is based on LENA version 1.3.3 and includes the following:\nLENA installation\nLinux-based\nWindows-based\n1.1. Components LENA consists of a Web Server, a WAS (Web Application Server), a Session Server, a Node Agent that monitors and controls the status of Web Servers, an Advertiser installed on Application Servers that provides status information, and the Manager, an integrated management tool for administrators.\n1.1.1. Server LENA provides three types of servers: Web Server, Application Server, and Session Server. Their roles are as follows:\nWeb Server: Provides web resources based on user requests. It acts as the front for application services provided by the Application Server and can optionally provide load balancing and a security layer (SSL).\nApplication Server: Runs and serves applications written in Java.\nSession Server: Maintains user sessions across Application Servers.\n1.1.2. Agent, Advertiser Agents are installed on Nodes and Servers and are responsible for control and monitoring.\nNode Agent\nAggregates Web Server status monitoring data and provides it to the Manager.\nAdvertiser\nAggregates Application Server status monitoring data and provides it to the Manager.\n1.1.3. Manager The Manager is a web application that provides control and monitoring of Nodes and Servers through the Node Agent and Advertiser. Representative features include the following.\nTable 1. LENA Manager key features Item Description Dashboard\nStatus of Servers and Server Clusters\nNotification checks\nServer\nRegister/modify/delete System (logical server groups)\nServer Cluster\nRegister/modify/delete Server Clusters\nRegister/delete Servers to a Server Cluster\nCompare and synchronize configurations of Servers registered in a Server Cluster\nSnapshot for backup/restore of Server Cluster configuration\nGraceful restart of Servers registered in a Server Cluster\nResource\nView and register/modify/delete resources\nDatabase / DataSource / MessageService(JMS) / Transaction(JTA) / Application / LoadBalancer(SLB)\nView and register/modify/delete the list of servers using a resource\nDiagnostics + (Monitoring)\nIssue-status monitoring for servers\nView events occurring on servers\nTopology\nView server composition by System\nAdmin\nUser and permission management; mapping among user/role/menu\nView user operation history\nLicense management; status view and upload\n1.2. Mechanism LENA provides monitoring and centralized management of Web Servers and WAS through the Manager. To enable this, an Agent is installed per Node, called the Node Agent. The Node Agent receives user commands from the Manager to control the Web Server/WAS installed on the Node, and sends monitoring information for the host/VM where the Node is installed and for the Web Server back to the Manager.\nFigure 1. LENA Manager monitoring and centralized management workflow In addition to LENA Manager, Web Server, and WAS, components such as the Manager Repository used for Manager operations, the Session Server for session clustering, and the Advertiser for collecting WAS monitoring information enable monitoring and centralized management via the Manager.\nItem Description Manager\nManages configuration files deployed to servers and provides server monitoring\nManager Repository\nFile storage repository for Manager operations; includes various configuration and DB information\nNode Agent\nAggregates Web Server monitoring data and sends it to the Manager; executes control/configuration commands received from the Manager\nApplication Server\nApplication Server instance\nWeb Server\nWeb Server instance\nSession Server\nSession Server instance\nAdvertiser\nAggregates monitoring data and sends it to the Manager (integrated into the Application Server)\n2. Installation Prerequisite 2.1. System Requirements 2.1.1. Hardware Resource CPU\nThis entirely depends on how much performance the Web Application you want to run requires. For basic LENA service operation, we recommend 2 cores or more.\nMemory\nFor Memory, refer to the table below. All modules except Web Server operate on JVM basis and use Heap Memory. LENA has pre-configured default Heap Memory values, which are installed with these values during installation but can be modified as needed. For stable operation, ensure that the sum of Heap Memory settings for all modules installed on one physical server does not exceed the remaining memory capacity of the physical server.\nThe minimum requirements for installing LENA Manager and each Server are as follows:\nCategory JVM Disk Space Minimum Memory Default Memory Manager\nJDK 1.8 \u0026#43;\nAbout 300 MB\n512 MB\n1 GB\nNode Agent\nJDK 1.8 \u0026#43;\n-\n64 MB\n256 MB\nApplication Server\nJDK 1.8 \u0026#43;\nAbout 100 MB\n512 MB\n2 GB\nWeb Server\nJDK 1.8 \u0026#43;\nAbout 50 MB\n512 MB\n-\nSession Server\nJDK 1.8 \u0026#43;\nAbout 50 MB\n512 MB\n1 GB\nEach Server is installed based on default Memory settings during installation, and Memory settings can be changed and applied above the minimum Memory requirements.\n2.1.2. Operating System Linux\nSupports Redhat (RHEL, CentOS) 6.5 or higher / Ubuntu 12.04 or higher and is the most recommended operating system. To match the characteristics of general x86 architecture, we recommend distributed installation on multiple low-capacity servers rather than large-capacity integrated server configuration.\nWindows\nSupports Windows 7 or higher. Unlike Linux/Unix, due to Windows characteristics, it provides Windows Service registration functionality to run LENA Module in the background. Otherwise, LENA Module always runs in the foreground.\nLinux/Unix basically provides scripts to run LENA Module.\nIf registration as OS Service is required, the server administrator must directly configure it according to the OS environment.\nUnix\nSupports Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX. Unlike Linux/Windows, Unix does not provide new versions and patches by default, and when needed, they are created and distributed through individual review by OS version, which typically requires about 2 weeks.\n2.1.3. Account Before installing LENA, an account is needed for LENA installation and startup. Unless there is a suitable reason, Root / Administrator accounts are not recommended for security reasons and cannot be used to run LENA, so create a separate account in advance.\nAlthough not recommended in X86 architecture, suppose multiple different business systems are operated on one physical server, and the responsible operators are separated by system, and accounts are separated for access control between systems. In this case, Node should be installed/configured and operated by operator account (by business system), and it is recommended to configure LENA Manager by system as well. 2.1.4. Directory Before proceeding with LENA installation, you must prepare an installation directory that can be used by the account created in the previous step. The table below is the directory structure suggested by LENA, and you can use a directory structure that matches your policy. The table below is explained based on Linux/Unix, but for Windows, configure the directories identically under C:.\nTable 2. Directory Requirement Category Directory Notes LENA WAS Node(Binary)\n/engn001/lena\nLENA WEB Node(Binary)\n/engn001/lenaw\nWeb Server, WAS Log\n/logs001\nConfigure when log path separation is needed\nWeb Application Source\n/sorc001\nThe consideration is whether to separate log files. If not separately configured, logs are created by default under the path where LENA Node is installed. To make log checking easier and disk capacity management convenient, we recommend separating the log directory.\nIf possible, we recommend mounting separate external disk volumes to Node, log, and source directories to isolate them from the OS System area.\n2.1.5. JVM For JDK, it must be installed separately in binary form or through the package installation manager provided by the OS before proceeding with LENA installation.\nLENA Version EN(Engine No) JDK Version(LTS) JAVA EE Spec Servlet Spec 1.3.3.X\n9 (Default)\nJDK 8 (1.8.x+), 11, 17, 21\n8\n4.0\n1.3.3.X\n7\nJDK 6 (1.6.x+), 7 (1.7.x+), 8 (1.8.x+)\n6\n3.0\n1.3.3.X\n8\nJDK 8 ( 1.8.x+), 11\n7\n3.1\n1.3.3.X\n10\nJDK 11, 17, 21\n10 (Servlet)\n6.0\n1.3.2.X\n8 (Default)\nJDK 8 ( 1.8.x+), 11\n7\n3.1\n1.3.2.X\n7\nJDK 6 (1.6.x+), 7 (1.7.x+), 8 (1.8.x+)\n6\n3.0\n1.3.2.X\n9\nJDK 8 (1.8.x+), 11, 17\n8\n4.0\n1.3.2.X\n10\nJDK 11, 17\n10 (Servlet)\n6.0\n1.3.1.X\nN/A\nJDK 8 (1.8.x+), JDK 11\n7\n-\n1.3.0.X\nN/A\nJDK 8 (1.8.x+), JDK 11\n7\n-\nFor OracleJDK, only up to version 8u202 can be used for free.\n2.1.6. Network The diagram below shows the traffic flow between each LENA Module. LENA Management-related paths and Web Service-related paths are expressed in detail.\nFigure 2. LENA Network Traffic The traffic paths between LENA modules and the ports used as shown in the above diagram are as follows. The specified port numbers are predefined defaults and can be specified separately when installing each module. After selecting ports by referring to the table below, the firewall must be opened in advance.\nThe ports used by LENA use ports above 1025 for security requirements. However, if you need to use well-known ports such as port 80 when providing services, refer to the port 80 usage guide provided in the appendix.\nTable 3.

Based on this HTTP Port, other ports for server operation such as HTTPS port are automatically calculated and installed, examples of which are shown in italics in the table above. Therefore, when installing multiple Web Servers and WAS, to prevent conflicts with other ports already in use, we recommend installing with the same digits for 1s and 10s place by Web Server or WAS, and changing the 100s place.\nTable 4. HTTP Port Setting Example When Installing Web Server and WAS on Equipment with Same IP Category\nServer Name\nHTTP Port\nNotes\nWAS\nee_01\n8080\n-\nee_02\n8180\nee_01\u0026#8217;s HTTP Port value + 100\nWeb\nweb_01\n7180\n-\nweb_02\n7280\nweb_01\u0026#8217;s HTTP Port value + 100\nAlso, we recommend not using Dynamic Port Range for the entire port range. There is a possibility that other OS services may occupy ports required for LENA startup as source ports.\n3. Installation 3.1. LENA Installation Upload the LENA installation file to a prepared directory on the target server. Using the installation file, install LENA Manager on the server intended for the Manager, install the Web Server Node on the server intended for the Web Server, and install the WAS Node on the server intended for WAS.\nBefore proceeding with the LENA installation, refer to the JVM section of the Operator Manual and install the JDK in advance.\nAfter installing the Node, install the Web Server and WAS through the LENA Manager Web UI. The LENA installation files are categorized as follows by product edition and purpose.\nTable 5.

Session Server Installation and Integration Install the Session Server when applying Session Clustering; it can be installed in the following two ways.\nStandalone mode: Install Session Server on a separate server\nEmbedded mode: Do not install Session Server on a separate server; install it in embedded form within an already installed WAS\nStandalone Mode Installation and WAS Integration The Session Server can be installed on a WAS Node. Select the 'SERVER' menu at the top of LENA Manager and select the WAS Node where you will install the Session Server. At the bottom of the WAS List, you can check the Session Server List where the installed Session Servers can be viewed.\nFigure 31. Viewing Session Server List Figure 32. Session Server installation popup and example inputs Clicking the 'Install' button opens a popup to enter information for installing the Session Server, and the input items are as follows.\nServer Type: Standalone (fixed)\nNode: Node where the Session Server will be installed (not editable)\nServer ID: Name for LENA Manager to identify the Session Server\nService Port: Port that the Session Server will use\nMirror Server IP: Node where the other Session Server is installed (choose from registered Nodes)\nMirror Server Port: Port used by the Session Server on the Node where the other Session Server is installed\nRun User: OS account used to start the Session Server (not editable)\nInstall Root Path: Path where the Session Server will be installed (not editable)\nLog Home: Path for Session Server logs\ndefault: [Install Root Path]/logs\nEnter manually: user-defined path\nAfter entering all Session Server installation information, click the 'Save' button to install the Session Server; you can check it in the Session Server List.\nIn a Session Clustering configuration, install two Session Servers and configure redundancy with one as Primary and the other as Secondary.\nIn the example above, another WAS Node is specified for 'Mirror Server IP'; install a Session Server on that WAS Node as well as below.\nFigure 33. Installing the other Session Server After installing all Session Servers, select the 'Session' tab on the WAS settings screen to integrate with WAS.\nThe 'Session' tab manages the settings required to apply Session Clustering for WAS by integrating with Session Servers. Change the 'Session Clustering Enable' item to 'Yes' to display detailed settings. In Standalone Mode, Session Servers are installed separately and integrated with WAS to apply Session Clustering.\nFigure 34. WAS Standalone mode Session Server settings Based on the Standalone mode Session Server, the settings are as follows.\nPrimary Server Host: Select the Node where the Session Server designated as Primary is installed, and select the Session Server.\nSecondary Server Host: Select the Node where the Session Server designated as Secondary is installed, and select the Session Server. When two Session Servers are installed, after selecting the Primary Server Host, the remaining Session Server is automatically designated as Secondary.\nExternal Stored Session: Along with applying Session Clustering, select whether to manage Session information on the two Session Servers only (instead of WAS and two Session Servers). This option is commonly used when configured on Cloud or Container environments. (Default false)\nShare session in applications: If multiple applications are deployed to WAS, select whether to share Session information among the applications. (Default false)\nMulti Login Control: Select whether to enable the duplicate login control feature. (Default false)\nFor Standalone mode Session Servers, you must apply the above settings for each WAS to which the configuration applies.\nAfter changing Session settings, the WAS must be restarted.\nEmbedded Mode Installation and WAS Integration Select the WAS on which you will use the Session Server function in Embedded mode, open the settings screen, and select the 'Session' tab at the top.\nThe 'Session' tab manages the settings required to apply Session Clustering for WAS by integrating with Session Server. Change the 'Session Clustering Enable' item to 'Yes' to display detailed settings. In Embedded Mode, the Session Server function is embedded in WAS and runs within WAS.\nFigure 35. WAS Embedded mode Session Server settings Based on the Embedded mode Session Server, the settings are as follows.\nEmbedded Host: When Embedded Mode is selected, it is fixed to the current WAS.\nEmbedded Port: Enter the port used by the Embedded Session Server.\nSecondary Server Host: Specify the WAS on which to use the other Embedded Session Server. Select the Node where WAS is installed, then select WAS.\nSecondary Server Port: Enter the port used by the other Embedded Session Server.\nMulti Login Contorl: Select whether to enable the duplicate login control feature. (Default false)\nAfter finishing entering and selecting the settings, click the 'Save' button to complete the Embedded Session settings. When the Embedded Session settings are completed on one WAS, the settings are also applied to the other WAS.\nAfter changing Session settings, the WAS must be restarted.\nFigure 36. Completion of WAS Embedded mode Session Server settings 3.1.11. Verifying Inter-Server Integration This section explains how to verify the integration settings performed through the processes described in WebA Server - WAS Integration, WebN Server - WAS Integration (Proxy), WebN Server - WAS Integration (Net Gateway), and Session Server Installation and Integration.\nLENA Manager provides a Topology View for easily checking the configuration of installed servers. Using this Topology feature, you can verify whether integration is normal, and you can also verify integration using the LENA Sample pages that come preloaded during Web Server and WAS installation.\nVerification via Topology Click the 'Topology' menu at the top of LENA Manager.\nFigure 37. Topology View In the Topology View, you can basically check the currently registered Nodes, the configuration of Servers installed per Node, and the integration information.\nIn the figure above, two Web Servers, two WAS, and two Session Servers are installed, and the integration settings between Web Server and WAS, and between WAS and Session Server are represented with connecting lines, through which you can verify that the inter-server integration has been performed correctly.\nVerification via Sample Page LENA\u0026#8217;s Web Server and WAS come with a default Sample Page and Sample Application. These can also be used to verify proper integration after initial installation.\nFirst, check the Web Server\u0026#8217;s IP and Port, then enter the following in a web browser.\nhttp://[Web Server IP]:[Web Server Port]/index.html\nYou will see that the index.html page provided by LENA is called as shown below, and you can verify that the Web Server is called successfully.\nFigure 38. Web Server call test Verification via Sample Application When you install LENA WAS, the default application provided by LENA is loaded. By calling index.jsp and session.jsp of this application, you can test WAS calls and Session Clustering respectively.\nAssuming that the Web Server and WAS are in their initial installed state, enter the following in a web browser.\nhttp://[Web Server IP]:[Web Server Port]/index.jsp\nIf the Web Server and WAS are connected normally, the request called with the Web Server IP and Port is forwarded to the WAS, which then requests the index.jsp page, and the index.jsp page provided by the LENA Sample Application is called as follows.\nFigure 39. index.jsp call test When you call the index.jsp page, you can check which WAS is handling the current request via the Server ID, Service Port, and JvmRout values.\nNext, call session.jsp with the same Web Server IP and Port as follows.\nhttp://[Web Server IP]:[Web Server Port]/session.jsp\nWhen you call session.jsp, additional Session information about the current request is displayed. As you repeat the calls, the Session Count increases, and from the second call, the issued Session ID is displayed. To verify that Session Clustering has been applied correctly, after a Session ID is issued, stop the WAS currently handling the request, then refresh the web browser to send the request again. Even though another running WAS handles the request, the Session ID remains the same and the Session Count increases, which confirms correct clustering.\nFigure 40. session.jsp call test Version 1.3.3.0\nLast updated 2025-09-21 08:28:03 +0900 "},{"id":8,"href":"/en/","title":"LENA Docs","parent":"","content":" What is LG CNS\u0026rsquo;s LENA Web Application Server / Web Server?

LENA is a web middleware solution that includes all components necessary for serving JAVA J2EE Web Applications in Enterprise environments.\nLENA consists of Server products that provide actual web services and a Web UI-based Manager Console for integrated management. Users can easily perform Server installation, Parameter configuration, and inter-product integration through the Manager Console, and with LENA\u0026#8217;s user-friendly UX/UI design, even users unfamiliar with web middleware solutions can quickly learn how to use them and acquire web middleware-related knowledge.\nLENA provides various convenience features by consolidating years of operational know-how from web middleware operators in data center/cloud environments. Additionally, it provides Clustering with high availability and fault tolerance, and failure diagnostics/response functionality to stably process large-scale transactions and minimize service failures.\nThe following sections explain LENA\u0026#8217;s features in more detail.\n1.2. LENA Features Enterprise Requirements Provision LENA Web Application Server EE (J2EE Edition) supports J2EE specifications such as EJB, JTA/XA, JMS, JAX-WS required for executing Enterprise Web Applications. Additionally, it has achieved improvements in startup performance and Application Deploy performance compared to third-party WAS, and resource usage efficiency such as CPU/Memory has also been improved. For high availability, Session Server is provided by default in Enterprise Edition for essential Session Clustering.\nOpen Source Compatibility Guarantee LENA Web Server and LENA WAS are implemented on Open Source Base, ensuring perfect Open Source compatibility. Web Applications written on Open Source basis can be applied to LENA without separate modifications, greatly reducing transition effort. Additionally, using standard technologies for libraries and configuration resolves vendor dependency and strengthens users' IT ownership.\nIntelligent Failure Diagnostics/Response and Service Tracing It can perform diagnostics based on pre-defined rules for representative failure situations such as Thread Pool Full / Hang / Out of memory and take appropriate measures. Based on real-time collected monitoring data, it analyzes and prevents failure situations through Fake Page bypass or forced restart before servers lead to actual failures, or minimizes failure time even if failures occur. Simultaneously, it provides related Dumps and Reports to enable cause analysis.\nMulti-Server Management and Centralized Operation Multiple LENA Web Servers and LENA WAS can be grouped into a single Cluster, allowing control of multiple servers simultaneously through single operation. Stable application is possible through consistent configuration synchronization along with Graceful Restart or Rolling Restart. Additionally, Multi Control is supported for servers not grouped in clusters.\nOperational Differentiation Features Provides various convenience features for easy operation of web middleware solutions. Using template-based simple and fast Server installation and Server replication features, desired configuration sets can be built in a short time. Through Topology View, configuration and integration information between Server modules can be checked at a glance, improving visibility. Through Dashboard, Events and performance status of operating systems can be checked. Additionally, through Multi Account management, menu/resource access permission settings are possible, and operator Action Tracing, configuration update information History tracking, and Restore functionality are provided.\n1.3. LENA Components and Key Concepts LENA is provided through Binary Package and includes all necessary components. Components are broadly divided into two categories.\nManagement Module for operating and managing LENA, including LENA Manager Console and LENA Node Agent.\nServer Module responsible for actual Web Service, including LENA Web Server, LENA WAS (Web Application Server), and LENA Session Server.\nThe following covers detailed descriptions of each component along with key concepts.\n1.3.1. Management Module LENA Manager LENA Manager is a Web Application designed to configure and control all resources/functions of LENA through Web UI. Installation and start can be performed through scripts prepared in the LENA Package. To perform Server installation/management through LENA Manager, integration with Node Agent and Advertiser must be configured.\nThe following explains representative functions and concepts provided by LENA Manager. For detailed information not described below, refer to the \"Operator Guide\".\nDashboard\nCheck resource status and Events of LENA Node and Server\nServer\nRegister LENA Node, install Web Server, WAS, Session Server, manage configuration, and control start/stop\nSystem\nMinimum unit for managing LENA Node and Server. Multiple Nodes can be registered under one System, but one Node cannot be registered in multiple Systems.\nNode\nConcept corresponding 1:1 with Node Agent. To execute commands on remote Servers from Manager, it must be done through Node Agent.\nCluster\nMulti-Server management. Cluster configuration is only possible for Servers within one System, and one Server cannot belong to multiple Clusters.\nServer Cluster\nMultiple LENA Web Servers and WAS can be managed as one group. Provides various convenience features such as configuration synchronization and integrated restart.\nResource\nWhile not a Module provided by LENA, it defines specifications for resources that are closely integrated with LENA Server, using them as Resources. Resources can be set locally for each LENA WAS, but through the Resource menu, they can be set globally and commonly imported by WAS, avoiding duplicate work.\nDatabase\nDefines physical specifications such as IP, Port, Driver of DBMS. Corresponds 1:1 with one DBMS.\nDatasource\nSpecifies JNDI Name, Url, User ID/Password for configuring DB Connection Pool in LENA WAS. Multiple Datasources can be configured under one Database.\nApplication\nSpecifies the location and Context Path of the Application to be executed through LENA WAS.\nTopology\nExpresses the configuration status of LENA Web Server, LENA WAS, LENA Session Server, etc. installed and integrated on LENA Manager in Topology Diagram format. Through this function, simple Server installation and start/stop control are also possible.\nDiagnostics\nEquipped with resource monitoring for LENA Node and Server and various related functions.\nLENA Node Agent LENA Node Agent corresponds 1:1 with Node when registering Node in LENA Manager, is installed by default in LENA Package, and can be started through prepared scripts. Main roles are handling commands for Servers under Node when executing commands through LENA Manager, and also performing the function of transmitting monitoring and status data to LENA Manager. One Node Agent per physical server is the default, but multiple Node Agents can be configured as needed. LENA Web Server, LENA WAS, and LENA Session Server are configured under LENA Node, and LENA Node is configured under one System.\n1.3.2. Server Module LENA Web Server LENA Web Server can transmit static content and integrates with LENA WAS in AJP or Reverse Proxy form, performing the front-end role for Web Application services provided by LENA WAS. Additionally, various optional additional functions can be used, with Domain/URI-based branching and Load Balancing functions and security layer (SSL) being representative.\nLENA WAS (Web Application Server) LENA WAS executes Java Web Applications to provide Web Application services. It includes Datasource integration functionality for using DB Connection Pool and Session Server integration functionality for using Session Clustering. The following explains the two types of LENA WAS.\nLENA WAS SE (Standard Edition)\nIt consists only of Servlet Engine for processing Java Class files and JSP Engine for processing JSP files, and can only execute WAR Type Web Applications. Compared to LENA WAS EE, it has the advantage of being relatively lightweight and fast.\nLENA WAS EE (Enterprise Edition)\nIn addition to the Engine provided by LENA WAS SE, it supports J2EE specifications such as EJB Engine, JMS Engine, and can execute WAR/EJB/EAR Type Applications. Additionally, it supports XA Datasource for 2 Phase Commit.\nLENA WAS internally mounts Advertiser Module, which collects LENA WAS\u0026#8217;s JVM internal monitoring results through JMX and transmits them to LENA Manager.\nLENA Session Server LENA Session Server is provided to ensure high availability through WAS redundancy by sharing sessions between multiple LENA WAS. It is provided by default when using LENA Enterprise Edition, and Session Clustering can be configured through Active-Active Clustering (bidirectional Active-Standby) with 2 LENA Session Servers. To use LENA Session Server, no separate configuration is needed in the Application, and it can be implemented with simple configuration in LENA Manager.\nHowever, all objects stored in HTTP Session must be serializable (Serializable) to perform Session-clustering.\n1.4. LENA Operation Method Node Agent is installed on Nodes registered in Manager, and Advertiser is installed on Application Server.\nOperators send control requests for Server (e.g., Start, Stop, Reload, Dump, configuration changes, etc.) to each Node Agent through Manager\u0026#8217;s UI, and Node Agent receives and executes the control.\nNode Agent and Advertiser periodically transmit monitoring data to Manager, and operators can check resource status of each server through Manager\u0026#8217;s UI such as Monitoring Dashboard. For Session Server, it directly transmits its own monitoring data to Manager.\nFigure 1. LENA Mechanism Table 1.

Edition-specific Provided Specifications LENA is divided into Standard and Enterprise Edition according to the functional scope provided by Application Server. While Standard Edition supports Web Application-centered specifications, Enterprise Edition supports J2EE specifications such as JTA, JMS, EJB and provides Session Clustering. Functions or specifications provided by each Edition are as follows.\nTable 2.

Enter a date to query Snapshot history. You can view details of Snapshot history and restore to a desired point in time.\nClick the list button in the Detail column of the Snapshot list to view details for that snapshot.\nSnapshot information is managed per server, so servers added to the Cluster after a particular Snapshot was created are excluded from restoration to that Snapshot. (In this case, after restoring the Snapshot, perform Sync again so that all servers have the same configuration.) Also, if a specific server is deleted from the Cluster after a Snapshot, all Snapshot information for that server is deleted. When creating a Snapshot, source code is not copied to the Snapshot; the copied configuration files include only basic configuration files, application configuration files, and enterprise.xml.\nCreating Snapshots can put a load on disk capacity, so create with care. Also, created Snapshots are not deleted automatically; the user must delete them manually. Therefore, we recommend deleting unnecessary Snapshots at an appropriate time.\n6. Resource 6.1.

Thread information by state in the selected Thread Dump file 7.5. Diagnostics and Actions By using Diagnostics and Actions, you can proactively diagnose potential failures and automatically perform appropriate actions to improve server stability.\nThe diagnostics feature automatically determines the possibility of server failure (or a failure state) based on rules.\nThe action feature helps maintain stable service by automatically performing appropriate server controls based on diagnostic results to withstand failure situations.\nThe target diagnostic types are as follows.\nExcessive use of the Request Pool (Request Full)\nWhen service requests are excessive and all available Request Threads on the server are exhausted, service requests may be delayed or result in an unavailable state. Based on Request Thread usage, determine whether service requests are excessive, and automatically redirect such requests to a temporary page to keep the server stable.\nBulk DB Data Request\nWhen a service processes large amounts of DB data, it may consume excessive memory, leading to OOM, frequent Full GCs, and server hang. Determine whether a service is making bulk DB data requests, and forcibly terminate the service to keep the server stable.\nExcessive use of the DB Connection Pool (DB Conn Full)\nWhen DB connections are overly occupied due to DB processing delays, WAS-DB network latency, or DB locks, services are delayed until they can obtain an available DB connection. If services waiting for DB connection allocation accumulate and overly occupy the Request Thread Pool, it may lead to service unavailability. When all DB connections in a specific DataSource are exhausted, shorten the allocation wait time to isolate the failure and keep the server stable.\nLong-running services (Long Transaction)\nIf services are delayed due to transient network or inter-system issues, or if there are inherently long-running services, those services can excessively occupy available Request Threads, hindering other services. Limit Request Thread usage for long-running services to guarantee QoS for other services.\nServer hang (Hang)\nWhen the server enters a hang state where it cannot operate, not only are all tasks stopped, but it may also affect the entire system where the server is installed. When a hang is detected, restart immediately to resolve the server failure and prevent system-wide failures.\nOut of Memory error (OOM)\nOOM errors can occur due to service logic errors or excessive memory usage. Because normal server operation cannot be guaranteed when OOM occurs, quickly detect OOM and automatically restart to overcome the server failure.\nUser surge (Peak Control)\nWhen the number of user requests exceeds server capacity, services may be delayed or unavailable. If user requests concentrate on a specific service, control requests to enter sequentially to provide stable service while preventing user churn. This also guarantees QoS for other services.\n7.5.1. Diagnostics/Action Rule Setting You can configure Diagnostics/Action Rules from DIAGNOSTICS \u0026gt; Policy \u0026gt; Diagnostics Rule Setting.\nFigure 43. Diagnostics Rule Setting screen Rules are organized by tab for each diagnostic type, and basic Default Rules are provided. Click the New button to create a new Rule, or select an existing Rule to edit or delete it.\nTwo Default Rules are provided for each diagnostic item as follows:\nA rule that only generates a Report after diagnosis\nA rule that generates a Report and Dump after diagnosis (Action is provided as Disabled)\nRule settings by diagnostic type are as follows.\nTable 152.

If the status is determined to be in that state, it is displayed as High status.\n8.2.1. Control [Edit: OFF] Provides detailed monitoring information and control functions from Client to Database from an E2E (End to End) perspective.\nFigure 64. Topology Control [Edit: OFF] CLIENT Area Client refers to users, and you can check the browser screen rendering time when users make requests to the Web Server and the content of script errors.\nWEB Area The WEB area provides information about installed Web Nodes and Web servers and allows server control.\nConfiguration Information\nWeb Node is the area where Web servers are installed, and you can check the server installation status by node.\nMonitoring Information\nWeb Node provides basic CPU, Memory, Disk status information by default.\nWhen you hover over a Web Server, it provides CPU, Memory, Thread status information in a popup form.\nWhen you select a Web Node and a Server, you can get real-time detailed monitoring information for each in the Resource Monitoring Area on the right side of the Topology Area.\nNode : CPU, Memory, Disc, Network and basic information\nServer : CPU, Memory, Thread, QoS and basic information\nControl Functions\nServer provides three main control functions.\nServer Control : Start, Stop, Service Control\nService Control provides uninterrupted deployment functionality. This is a method in which the source corrected for an error service is immediately deployed to the WAS and then the Web Server (timely server) that calls this WAS is configured to forward the error service to the timely server, thereby ensuring normal service provision.\nTo use this function, the LSC module must be enabled in the Web Server (httpd-lsc.conf file, change LscEnable to On, and restart the server).\nAfter defining the control time, control conditions (Header, Cookie, URL) and the server to forward (http://IP:Port) to save, it connects incoming requests in real-time to the corresponding server according to the defined content, thereby providing service without server restart.\nMove to : Configuration\nCluster : Compare, Sync, Snapshot, Graceful Restart\nAPPLICATION Area APPLICATION Area provides information about installed WAS Nodes and WAS servers and allows server control.\nConfiguration Information\nWAS Node is the area where WAS servers are installed, and you can check the server installation status by node.\nMonitoring Information\nWAS Node provides basic CPU, Memory, Disk status information by default.\nWhen you hover over a WAS Server, it provides CPU, Thread, Heap status information in a popup form.\nWhen you select a WAS Node and a Server, you can get real-time detailed monitoring information for each in the Resource Monitoring Area on the right side of the Topology Area.\nNode : CPU, Memory, Disc, Network and basic information\nServer : Warning, CPU, Memory, Thread, QoS and basic information\nControl Functions\nServer provides four main control functions.\nServer Control : Start, Stop, Forced Stop\nDump : Thread Dump, Active Service Dump, Heap Dump\nMove to : Configuration, Monitoring\nCluster : Compare, Sync, Snapshot, Graceful Restart\nSESSION Area SESSION Area provides information about installed Session Nodes and Session servers and allows server control.\nConfiguration Information\nSession Node is the area where Session servers are installed, and you can check the server installation status by node.\nMonitoring Information\nSession Node provides basic CPU, Memory, Disk status information by default.\nWhen you hover over a Session Server, it provides CPU, Session Count, Heap status information in a popup form.\nWhen you select a Session Node and a Server, you can get real-time detailed monitoring information for each in the Resource Monitoring Area on the right side of the Topology Area.\nNode : CPU, Memory, Disc, Network and basic information\nServer : CPU, Memory, Session Count and basic information\nControl Functions\nServer provides two main control functions.\nServer Control : Start, Stop\nMove to : Configuration\nDB Area DB Area provides information about the Database connected to WAS. The Database must be registered in the RESOURCE menu. Nodes are represented as virtual nodes to be consistent with other areas. Monitoring and control functions for each DB are not provided.\nEdge Information The connection line means the connection between instances, or between an instance and a Database, and represents the average response time of the server and the number of connected connections.\nClient-WEB : Connection count (Average browser rendering completion time (ms)/Average Web Server response time (ms))\nWEB-APPLICATION : Active Connection count (Average WAS response time (ms))\nAPPLICATION-DB : Active Datasource usage rate (%)\nEnd to End monitoring functionality is set to off by default.\nTherefore, to view the average browser rendering response time between Client-WEB or the average response time of the server, you must set it in the following order:\nmanager.conf file, set diagnostics.e2e.enable=true\nIn the httpd.conf file of the Web Server, uncomment httpd-eum.conf\n\u0026lt;IfDefine MOD_EUM\u0026gt; #LENA E2E Monitoring Extension settings Include ${INSTALL_PATH}/conf/extra/httpd-eum.conf \u0026lt;-- Uncomment this line \u0026lt;/IfDefine\u0026gt; Web Server\u0026#8217;s eum/eum.properties file, modify agent_enable value to true\nHowever, this function is not supported on window OS.\n8.2.2.

Session Server Details Application Server session clustering shares sessions by installing a separate Session Server. The Session Server has a Standalone mode that runs on a separate VM and an Embedded mode where the Session Server module is embedded in the Application Server.\n10.12.1. Session Server Standalone Mode Installation For installation, refer to Install.\nStart/Stop and Status Check For start/stop and status checks, see Start/Stop.\nConfiguration The location where the Session Server is installed is referred to as ${ZODIAC_HOME}. The Session Server is located under the LENA home /servers folder.\nConfiguration information is managed in ${ZODIAC_HOME}/session.conf. The configuration items that can be changed are as follows.\nItem Description server_id\nserver ID\nserver_name\nserver Name\nprimary_port\nTCP listening port of the Session Server\nsession_max_count\nMaximum number of HTTP sessions\nserver_recv_queue_size\nQueue size for processing requests for session information (update to latest/new registration, logout) received from the Secondary Server or Application Server\nserver_req_queue_size\nQueue size that holds requests for session information received from other servers (session info requests, latest info checks, etc.)\nresp_queue_size\nQueue size that holds responses to session information requested by other servers\nsend_queue_size\nQueue size that holds session information to be sent to other servers\nkeep_alive_time\nInterval at which dummy messages are sent to maintain the TCP connection between Application Server and Session Server. Must be less than so_timeout. It is recommended to match each Application Server setting.\nso_timeout\nread timeout in the connection with Application Server\nthread_request_handler\nNumber of threads that process data accumulated in the request Queue.\nthread_data_handler\nNumber of threads that process data accumulated in the receive Queue.\ndebug_clustering\nWhether to leave debug logs\nenable_auto_was_sync\nWhen set to true, sends a Sync request to the reconnected WAS (due to failure, etc.) to sync the WAS session data.\nenable_auto_peer_sync\nWhether to send a Sync request to the reconnected Secondary Session Server (due to failure, etc.) to sync the Slave Session Server\u0026#8217;s session data\nserver_expire_sec\nTime to expire HTTP session information on the server (Session Timeout)\nIf 0, use the session timeout set by the Application\nserver_expire_check_sec\nSession Timeout check interval (seconds)\nsecondary_host\nAddress of the Secondary session server\nsecondary_port\nAddress of the Secondary session server\nenable_ready_after_sync\nWhether to send the Ready state (available to provide clustering service) to connected WAS after performing session data synchronization with the Secondary Server (true sends Ready after synchronization)\nwait_server_ready_timeout\nIf the Ready state (available to provide Session Clustering service) is not reached by this time, it will automatically be set to Ready.\nserver_ready_time\nWait time to connect to the Secondary Server at startup (this value * 100 ms).\nmax_logoutset\nMaximum number of logged-out HTTP sessions\nenable_auto_logout_sync\nIf true, sync logout information together when syncing session entry information (needed for round-robin when not sticky)\nLogs Logs are stored at ${LENA_HOME}/logs/session-server/lena-[Session Server Name]_[YYYYMMDD].log. You can also check logs by running the ${ZODIAC_HOME}/log.sh file.\n[session_5002]$ ./log.sh May 09, 2018 02:55:50 PM [ZODIAC] TCP listen 5002 May 09, 2018 02:55:54 PM [ZODIAC] ACCEPT NODE(Tomcat) /127.0.0.1:33138 May 09, 2018 02:55:55 PM [ZODIAC] SERVER_READY, no peer, time=5000 May 09, 2018 02:59:57 PM [ZODIAC] Zodiac Stop May 09, 2018 03:00:00 PM [ZODIAC] Zodiac Session Server 1.3.0 20160420 May 09, 2018 03:00:01 PM [ZODIAC] TCP listen 5002 May 09, 2018 03:00:01 PM [ZODIAC] ACCEPT NODE(Tomcat) /127.0.0.1:33359 May 09, 2018 03:00:03 PM [ZODIAC] ACCEPT SERVER /127.0.0.1:46818 May 09, 2018 03:00:04 PM [ZODIAC] SYNC[session_5002] recv bulk sessions : #0 recv bulk logout sessions : #0 recv bulk dupInfo : #0 2ms May 09, 2018 03:00:04 PM [ZODIAC] SERVER_READY sync is done May 09, 2018 03:00:05 PM [ZODIAC] TCP Primary name=session_5002 /127.0.0.1:5002 May 09, 2018 03:00:05 PM [ZODIAC] SYNC start 127.0.0.1:5002 May 09, 2018 03:00:05 PM [ZODIAC] SYNC Send bulk sessions send to 127.0.0.1:5002 #0 and logout session send : 0 and dupInfo send : 0 Console Zodiac Session Server provides APIs via JMX to query Session Server information and to execute Application Server sync commands.
